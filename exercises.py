#Logic 

#Conditional statements gives us the ability to check conditions and make decisions based on the condition.

#In this assignment, you'll be asked to create conditional statements using if, elif and else. 

# Please commit and push your code after each completed exercise.

#1. Declare a variable named weather and assign it a string value of 'rain'. Next create a conditional statement that will check the weather and print 'Bring an umbrella' if weather equals 'rain'.
weather = 'rain'
if weather == 'rain':
    print('Bring an umbrella')
#2 Declare a variable named score and assign it a number value of 70. Next create a conditional statement that will check the score and print 'You pass!' if the score is 70 and above and print 'Study harder!' if the score is less than 70.
score = 70
if score >= 70:
    print('You pass!')
else:
    print('Study harder!')
#3. Declare a variable named download_speed and assign it a data value of 50. Next create a conditional statement that will check the download speed and print the following based on the condition:
download_speed = 50

# <= 50: 'Basic Package'
# <=100: 'Premium Package'
# >100: 'Platinum Package'
